(Verse)
[Am _ , G _ (Em), Dm _ (Em), F] x2
I see ya blowin' me a kiss, it doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on baby
If you see something in my eye, let's not over analyze
... don't go too deep with it baby

(Pre-chorus)
[Dm (Em), F, Am, G (Em)] x2 
So let it be what it'll be, don't make a fuss and get 
crazy over you and me.... mmm
Here's what I'll do, I'll play the wuss, not like we 
have a date with destiny

(Chorus)
[Dm (Em), F, Am, G] x2
It's just a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you

[4 bars instrumental
[Dm (Em), F, Am, G] x2

(Verse)
[Am _ , G _ (Em), Dm _ (Em), F] x2
It's raising my adrenaline, you're banging on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it baby
You say the word "forevermore", t hat's not what I'm looking for
All I can commit to is "maybe"

(Pre-chorus)
[Dm (Em), F, Am, G (Em)] x2 
So let it be what it'll be, don't make a fuss and get 
crazy over you and me.... mmm
Here's what I'll do, I'll play the wuss, not like we 
have a date with destiny

(Chorus)
It's just a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la

[Dm (Em), F (Em), Dm, (Em) F, 

Vanilla skies (vanilla skies)
White picket fences in your eyes

[Am, Gm (Em) Dm (Em), F
A vision of you and me


It's just a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you
