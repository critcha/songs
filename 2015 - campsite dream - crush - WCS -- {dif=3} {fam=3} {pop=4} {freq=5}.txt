[Original in E/C#m = D/Bm + capo

(Verse)
[Bm _ , A _ (Dm), Em _ (F#m), G] x2
I see ya blowin' me a kiss, it doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on baby
If you see something in my eye, let's not over analyze
... don't go too deep with it baby

(Pre-chorus)
[Em (F#), G, Bm, A (Dm)] x2 
So let it be what it'll be, don't make a fuss and get 
crazy over you and me.... mmm
Here's what I'll do, I'll play the wuss, not like we 
have a date with destiny

(Chorus)
[Em (F#m), G, Bm, A] x2
It's just a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you

[4 bars instrumental
[Em (F#), G (A), Bm (D), A (D)] x2

(Verse)
[Bm _ , A _ (Dm), Em _ (F#m), G] x2
It's raising my adrenaline, you're banging on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it baby
You say the word "forevermore", t hat's not what I'm looking for
All I can commit to is "maybe"

(Pre-chorus)
[Em (F#), G, Bm, A (Dm)] x2 
So let it be what it'll be, don't make a fuss and get 
crazy over you and me.... mmm
Here's what I'll do, I'll play the wuss, not like we 
have a date with destiny

(Chorus)
[Em (F#m), G, Bm, A] x2
It's just a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la

Vanilla skies (vanilla skies)
[6    8      3^ 9 8 7  8    7    
White picket fences in your eyes

[Am, Gm (Em) Dm (Em), F
[6    8  3^ 8   3^8 9   
A vision of you and me


It's just a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you
