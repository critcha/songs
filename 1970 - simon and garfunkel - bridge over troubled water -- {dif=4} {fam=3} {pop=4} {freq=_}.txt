G          Gm      D
    I will lay me down.

When you're down and out,
When you're on the street,
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you.

I'll take your part.
When darkness comes
And pain is all around,

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.

[instrumental bridge]

Sail on silvergirl,
Sail on by.
Your time has come to shine.
All your dreams are on their way.

See how they shine.
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind.

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind.
