Em,C,Am,B7

 	Your subleties
 	They strangle me
 	I can't ex	plain myself at all
 	And all the wants
 	And all the needs
 	All I don't 	want to need at all

Pre Chorus:
	
	C,G,C,Bm,Am,D
 	The walls start breathing
	My minds unwea	ving

Maybe it's best you leave me alone
 	A weight is li	fted
On this e	vening

 	D
I give the 	final blow

 	G	C
When 	darkness turns to light	
 	Em
It ends tonight 	
 	D
It ends tonight 	

 	Em
 	A falling star
 	C
 	Lest I fall alone
 	Am	B7
 	I can't ex	plain what you can't explain
 	Em
 	You're finding things
 	C
 	That you didn't know
 	Am	B7
 	I look at 	you with such disdain

Pre Chorus:

Chorus:

 	G	C
When 	darkness turns to light	
 	Em
It ends tonight 	
 	D
It ends tonight 	
 	G
Just a little in	sight
 	C
Won't make this right	
 	Em
It's too late to fight	
 	D
It ends tonight	
It ends tonight

Bridge:

 	Em			D
 	Now I'm 	on my own side
 	A					C
 	It's better than 	being on your side
 	Em		D						A
 	I's my 	fault when you're bli	nd
					C	
It's better that I 	see through your eyes	
Bm 			C					Am7
All these 	thoughts locked insi	de
				D
Now you're the 	first to know
