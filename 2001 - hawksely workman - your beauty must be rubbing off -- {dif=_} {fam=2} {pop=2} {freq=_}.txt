look at those buggers who are looting the crash site
taking the ring off your sweet little finger
that i gave to you, when we got married
you're under water now, you're back where you came from
no stealing of beauty that would naturally flow
from the center of all that you are, all that you are

your beauty must be rubbing off
your beauty must be rubbing off on me

if we had children they'd be lovely and beautiful
and posses a peace and strength and a depth in their eyes
and a Soundness in heart, even as they cry (Rah!)
and we as lovers move like lilies at midnight
to taste our bellies before god
we are witness to currents we cannot control, cannot control

your beauty must be rubbing off
your beauty must be rubbing off on me
your beauty must be rubbing off 
your beauty must be rubbing off on me

it's all the faces that you never had, or that you never have
to the shivers you couldn't shake the planes
you didn't make the hooks that didn't take off at night
in your window as you fight with the curtains
to cover up your nakedness from the neighbor's gaze such a sweet display
of nothingness of everything of never mind
these thing are fine the sweet tooth sunsets forgets tonight

cacphony, cacaphoney

so let me say that you look lovely in all of this
and let me say that the death that i fear
could in part be a fear that I'd lose you, your just as i found you

your beauty must be rubbing off
your beauty must be rubbing off on me
your beauty must be rubbing off
your beauty must be rubbing off on me

don't be a stranger to the danger that is kissing you x2
your beauty must be rubbing off
(repeat until end)
