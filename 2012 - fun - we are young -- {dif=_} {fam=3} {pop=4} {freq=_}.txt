Give me a second I, _ I need to get my story straight, my 
friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State, my
lover she's waiting for me _ just across the bar, my seta's been
taken by some sunglasses _ asking 'bout a scar, _ and

_ I know I gave it to you months ago _ _ _ _ _ 
_ I know you're trying to forget _ _ _ _ But be - 
tween the drinks _ and subtle things, _ the 
holes in my apologies, _ _ you 
 know I'm trying hard _ to take it back _ _ _ 

So if by that 

[Am,G,Am,G,F,F,G,C]
time _ _ the bar closes _ and you 
feel like falling down _ _ I'll
carry _ you home _

Tonight _ _ _ _ _ we are 
young _ _ _ _, so let's set the world on 
fire _ _ we can burn brigh - ter _ than the sun...
_ _ _ _ whoah...
x2

Now I 
know that _ I'm not _ _ _ 
All that _ you got _ _ _
_ I guess that I, _ I just thought _ 
_ Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
_ _ _ But our friends are back _
_ _ _ So let's raise a glass _
_ _ _ ‘Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight _ _ _ _ _ we are 
young _ _ _ _, so let's set the world on 
fire _ _ we can burn brigh - ter _ than the sun...
_ _ _ _ whoah...

Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)

The moon is on my side (Nananananana)
I have no reason to run (Nananananana)
So will someone come and carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
The angels never arrived (Nananananana)
But I can hear the choir (Nananananana)
So will someone come and carry me home (Nananananana)

Tonight _ _ _ _ _ we are 
young _ _ _ _, so let's set the world on 
fire _ _ we can burn brigh - ter _ than the sun...
_ _ _ _ whoah...

So if by that

time _ _ the bar closes _ and you 
feel like falling down _ _ I'll
carry _ you home _
