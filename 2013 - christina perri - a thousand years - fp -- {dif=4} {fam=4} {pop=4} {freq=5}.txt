Heart beats fast, colors and 
promises.  How to be 
brave? How can I love when I'm a- 
fraid to fall? But watching you 
stand alone, all of my 
fear suddenly falls away some
how... One step 
clo...ser

(Chorus:)
I have died every day waiting for you
darling, don't be afraid I have loved you for a 
thousand years, I'll love you for a 
thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in 
all she is.  I will be 
brave, I will not let anything 
take away what's standing in 
front of me, every 
breath, every hour has come to 
this... one step 
clo... ser

(Chorus:)
I have died every day waiting for you
darling, don't be afraid I have loved you for a 
thousand years, I'll love you for a 
thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought you to me, and I have loved you for a 
thousand years, I'll love you for a 
thousand more

... one step 
clo... ser

... one step 
clo... ser


(Chorus:)
I have died every day waiting for you
darling, don't be afraid I have loved you for a 
thousand years, I'll love you for a 
thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought you to me, and I have loved you for a 
thousand years, I'll love you for a 
thousand more
