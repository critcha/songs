(spoken)
I try to save the world with writing
So naturally there's folks who think I must be able to
But just because you've seen me on your news feed
Doesn't mean I'm any less a human being than you

(sung)
And while there's a part of me
In that guy you've seen
In that dream you dream
I am so much more
And I wish I could do the things you think I'd do
I would change this world for sure
But I eat and sleep and breathe and bleed and feel
Sorry to disappoint you
But I'm real

(spoken)
I'd love to help the world and all its problems
But I'm one man, and that's all
So the next time there's a epidemic or a natural disaster
I'm flattered that you thought of me
But I'm not the one to call

(sung)
And while there's a part of me
In that guy you've seen
In that dream you dream
I am so much more
And I wish I could do the things you think I'd do
I would change this world for sure
But I eat and sleep and breathe and bleed and feel
Sorry to disappoint you
But I'm real
