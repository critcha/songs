you've got pies in the oven all a-
-cross the sea, i'm just here fighting for our 
liberty, that and a cold glass of beer
yeah that's why i'm here
and stealin' coins is not really stealin'
when i'm with these boys
no we don't share feelings
but we sure make noise
crashing on enemy walls
we crash till it falls
and if i fall to taste the ground,
and you hear that fire bell sound
but don't fear
it's just the bullets
bouncing off my helmet
don't fear
don't fear
it's just the bullets
bouncing off my helmet
don't fear
kindly
keep this between you and me baby
don't tell the papers just what i said
no just let them figure it out
what's in my head
on ships at bay
i tattooed an anchor right beside your name
an anchor so sure that i won't float away
it's under my uniform sleeve
it's there till i leave
and if i fall to taste the ground
and you hear that fire bell sound
well don't fear it's just the bullets
bouncing off my helmet
don't fear
don't fear 
it's just the bullets
bouncing off my helmet
don't fear
don't fear

don't fear 
it's just the bullets
bouncing off my helmet
don't fear
don't fear
it's just the bullets
bouncing off my helmet
don't fear
don't fear(don't fear)
it's just the bullets
bouncing off my helmet (it's just a bullet just a bullet that you hear)
don't fear
don't fear (don't fear)
it's just the bullets 
boncing off my helmet (it's just a bullet just a bullet that you hear)
don't fear
don't fear
