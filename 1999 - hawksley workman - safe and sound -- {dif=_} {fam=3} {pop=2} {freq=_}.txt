You slept through the last small town,
I'll wake you up when the next one comes around.
Your eyes are closed, like you truly believe
You're safe and sound with me

No looking back, no turning into salt.
The city was crumbling but, baby, we're not to fault.
When things got too rough, I promised you we'd leave.
You're safe and sound with me.

You're safe and sound with me,
Just like you always will - just like you always will be.

The wipers clear the windshield of the rain.
My shirt sleeve dries your eyes the very same.
We fit together like the ignition and the key.
You're safe and sound with me.

You're safe and sound with me,
Just like you always will - just like you always will be.

You're safe and sound with me,
Just like you always will - just like you always will be.

The glove box light shines bright enough to see.
You read the map like you were reading poetry.
And it just might take you forever to see,
That you're safe and sound with me.
