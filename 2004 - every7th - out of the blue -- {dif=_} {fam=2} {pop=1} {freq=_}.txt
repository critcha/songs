Evry7th - Out Of The Blue

It was a pleasure from the past, 
And though we tried to make it last, 
Sometimes I feel we should let it free,

In the absence of duration, 
There's no time to feel frustration, 
But how to fill this hole is anybodies guess,

It took years to see, 
That its better to let it go, 
After so long how was I, 
Supposed to know that I should,

Take the time to walk around, 
Find a place to feel the sound, 
Its ok to walk away, 
You'll be back again some day,

Use your mind when the world's not kind, 
Save, won't you save your heart, 
For when the world's not so dark,

Lost in a wilderness of blinking eyes, 
Stare at the moonlight and 
Count another troubled sunrise, 
Living harshly day to day, oh, 
Tangled and bruised,

Huddled close you want me to be, 
But only if you promise me that I can, 

Chorus 

Picture yourself with me 
and you will see that all my love is yours from inside out... from inside out!
