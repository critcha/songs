I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be...
It's even harder to picture,
That you're not here next to me.

You say it's too late to make it,
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed.
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun 
Sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever After" did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday.
I gave you my love to borrow,
But you just gave it away.

You can't expect me to be fine,
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down.

I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed.
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise.

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever After" did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.
Now I'm at a payphone

_ _   _ _   _ _   _ _  Man, _  fuck _ that _ shit. _   _ _
I'll be out _ spending all this money while you're sitting round _
wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing, _ _  
made it from the bottom now when you see me I'm stunning _ all

all of my cars _ start with a push of a button _ (while you're)
telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it. _ _ 
_ _ Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it,
_ don't need my name _ on my shirt, you can tell (th)at I'm ballin,

_ _ Swish. _ , _ _ What a shame (you) could have got picked, _ 
_ (you) had a really good game _ but you missed your last _ 
shot, _ so you talk about who you see at the top _ _ or
what you could have saw _ but sad to say _ it's over for. _

_ _ Phantom pulled _ up _ va- _ let, _  open doors.   _
_ (You) wished I'd go away (and) got whatchyou was looking for. _ 
_ _ Now it's me _ who dey want, so you can go and take that
little piece of shit _ witchyou
