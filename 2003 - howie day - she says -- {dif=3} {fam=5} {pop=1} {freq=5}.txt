"She Says"

Sweet is the sight
Of her room
Window opened by candlelight
How would you know
Cold winter on the shore
Chills the dress she wore
It's on the floor
Still it feels so warm today

And that's why I'm wondering why
You had to tell me
What's going on in your head
What's wrong
Come around to another time when you
Don't have to run

And when she said she wants somebody else
I hope you know that's she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and makes a sound
You'll never hear her the way that I do
And when she says she wants someone to love
I hope you know that she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and lets you down
I hope you know that she doesn't mean to

Swing into flight
Over hills.
Over her hills, it's twilight
I guess that's right now
While we're here
Tell me why it's so funny
That you're so funny
When you're mad
Always so mad. So mad

And that's why I'm wondering why
You had to tell me
What's going on in your head
What's wrong
Come around to another time when you
Don't have to run

[Chorus]

Well, I don't know we're going to
and I don't know what means to me
and you don't know what means to you

And she says she wants somebody else
I hope you know
She doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and
makes a sound
You'll never hear her the way that I do
And when she says she wants someone to love
I hope you know
She doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and lets you down I hope you know that she...

No
I hope you know...
