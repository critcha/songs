Original in E = D+capo

(Verse 1)
[D, Em, G_B, A
You know just what to say... shit, that scares me, 
I should just walk away... but I can't move my feet
The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed I was so much younger 
[D_F#, G, G_B, A
yesterday, oh

(Chorus)
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

[two lines of instrumental]

By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

(Verse 2)
You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head-on, got me weak in my knees
Yeah, something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, ye-eah
So much younger yesterday, oh, yeah

(Chorus)
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

You, yeah, till I tasted you
(I didn't know that I-I didn't know that I-till I tasted you)
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you,

(Verse)
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh.... Na-na-na-na
Lat da lat da dat dum... la-da-da-da 
The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
