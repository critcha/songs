[Original in B, play in G

[G,D_F#,Em,C]x2
Stop joking around for one minute
I'd rather cry right now
And play those sad notes on the piano
Let the rest of the band go home

[Am,Bm,C,G] x 2
'Cause I'll need you until morning
Please be here until the morning
Hold my hand until the morning 
Brings the light of day 
Am
to our eyes

And smell the burning leaves in autumn driveways
We'll be out on the road till way past supper
And leave the lamp lit low beside the window
If you can mop up a waterfall

'Cause I'll lead you until morning
Please be here until the morning
Hold my hand until the morning                         
Brings the light of day 
Am     D
to our eyes

[Am,C,D x 
Just hop a train, you hate to fly
Come see the pictures of my eyes
You want to laugh, I want to cry, cry, cry, cry

Please be here until the morning
Hold my hand until the morning
Chase my fears until the morning
Into the promised land
Please be here
