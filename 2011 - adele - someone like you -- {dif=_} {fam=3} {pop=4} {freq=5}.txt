[VERSE 1:
[Treble only:
[C,Em,Am,C
I heard that you're settled down
That you found the one and you're married now

[with bass:
[C,Em,Am,C
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess you found the things I couldn't give to you

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

PRE-CHORUS:
[Em,Am,F
[Em,Am,F,FM7,C,CM7
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

CHORUS:
[C,G,Am,F
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

VERSE 2:
[C,Em,Am,C
_ _ You know how the time flies, only 
_ _ yesterday was the time of our lives, we were 
born and raised in a summer haze, bound 
by the surprise of our glory days

PRE-CHORUS:
[Em,Am,F
[Em,Am,F,FM7,C,CM7
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

CHORUS:
[C,G,Am,F
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

BRIDGE:
[Em,Am,F,Am,
[Em,Am,Dm,Em,F
Nothing _ compares, no worries _ or cares, re -
grets and mistakes, they're memories made.
Who would have known how _ _ bitter - 
Sweet _ _ _ this _ would _ taste?

CHORUS:
[C,G,Am,F
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
