





Everything's different
My head in the clouds
I hit this corner 
With my foot on the gas 
I started sliding
I lose it 
Everything's different 
Just like that 

Oh my God 
Wait and see 
What will soon become of me... 
Frozen heart
Screaming wheels 
Or does that screaming come from me? 

So damn lucky, 
That you went on ahead 
You said, you said
"I'll see you later..."
I heard what you said 
A few minutes later 
I'm sliding 
Everything's different again 

Oh my God, 
Wait and see 
What will soon become of me... 
This frozen heart 
Screaming wheels 
Or does that screaming come from me? 
I'm dizzy from all this spinning 

Now I'm thinking that you did all you could 
When you said "My love, 
Take it slowly..." 
"Ok" is what I said
 
Oh my God, 
Wait and see 
What will soon become of me... 

Frozen heart 
Screaming wheels 
Or does that screaming come from me? 

Take me back 
To just before I was spinning 
Take me back 
To just before I got dizzy 
Take me back
Amazing what a minute can do 
Just like you
 
So, so, slide, slide, up, around, around, around 
Again amazing what a minute can do 
Around, Around, Around 
"Again",
"Ok."
