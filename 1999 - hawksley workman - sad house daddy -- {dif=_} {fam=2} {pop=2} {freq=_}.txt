Sad house daddy open up the door
We're all good people
We're all good people down here
Sad house daddy open up the door
We're all good people
We're all good people down here
And i'm sure there are things you're simply not telling us
And i'm sure it's for our very own good
And sorry for the times our eyes weren't open
And sorry bout the darkness in the sky
