[Summary:
[Legs, darling, people, honey now, we found love
[Hair, soul, people, baby, we found love

_ _ When your legs don't work like they used to before
_ _ And I can't sweep you off of your feet
_ _ Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
_ _ Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? 

... _ _ _ And, darling, 
I _ _ will be loving you _ _ 'til we're 70
_ _ _ _    _ _ _ and, baby, my 
_ _ heart could still fall as _ _ hard at 23
_ _ _ And I'm thinking 'bout _ _ how 


(Chorus 1)
[Em, A, D, Em, A] x2
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand    _ _ _ _ 
Me, I fall in love with you every single day, _ _ And 
I just wanna tell you I am

							
... _ _ _ So, honey, now
_ _ _ _    _ _ Take me into your loving arms
_ _ _ _    _ _ Kiss me under the light of a 
thousand stars _ _    _ _ Place your head on my beating heart
_ _ _ I'm thinking out _ _ loud, _ maybe 
we found love right where we are

_ _ When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
_ _ And the crowds don't remember my name
_ _ When my hands _ don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
_ _ I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your 
_ _ soul could never grow _ _ old, it's evergreen
_ _ _ _    _ _ _ And, baby, your 
_ _ smile's forever in my mind and memory
_ _ _ I'm thinking 'bout how 


(Chorus 2)
[Em, A, D, Em, A] x2
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now
_ _ Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
