(Chorus:)
[C,G-Em,F,G x 2
Woa, oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Woa, oh, oh
For the longest

(Verse 1:)
[C(c),Em_B(e),Am7(g),G(dg),!!F,C
[C,Em_B(e),Am7(g),G(dg),!!D,G
[E,Am,G,C-C7
[F,Dm7,G,C
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do, I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time

(Verse 2:)
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me, when you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

(Chorus:)
Woa, oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Woa, oh, oh
For the longest

(Verse 3:)
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you, and how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time

(Bridge 1:)
[G,Am,B7,C,
[Em,Am,D,G-G7
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right, and I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far, and it's more than I hoped for

(Verse 4:)
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances, I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

(Bridge 2:)
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself, hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far, and it's more than I hoped for

(Verse 5:)
I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad, I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time

(Chorus:
Woa, oh, oh, oh 
For the longest time
Woa, oh,oh
For the longest time
Woa, oh, oh
For the longest time
Woa, oh, oh,
For the longest time
(Fade Out)
