This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
(g	         a    b   g-e   ...
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
...
I've got my heart set... on anywhere but here
...                      g        b      c-a
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years

[Am,Fm,Am,Fm,
[a  b  c      e    d    a   c-a
Steady hands, just take the wheel...
[   a  b  c      e  d  a-g  a
And every glance is killing me
[a	 b  c    e   d    a c-d    _e   g   a    g _e
Time to make one last appeal... for the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really... need
[g      e   g   e    a e
Oh, can you see what I see

They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could...

Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'ma run till you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down...

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
[								^c-d-g
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
d	g   a     e
Oh, you don't need

What you need, what you need...

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be
Oh, do you see what I see...
