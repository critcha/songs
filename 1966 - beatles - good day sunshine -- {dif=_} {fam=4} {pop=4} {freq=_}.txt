THE BEATLES LYRICS
"Good Day Sunshine"

[E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E

[A,E(bass:e,f#,a),A,E(bass:e,f#,a),D-D7
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine

[G(bflat-a-g),Em,A-A7,D,D7,G
I need to laugh and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground	

Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine

Then we lie beneath the shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.
[(G,G7)
