    Em                      C
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      D               Asus4   Am
Not a footprint to be seen
  Em            C
A kingdom of isolation
       D                  Asus4    A
And it looks like I'm the queen              
Em          C                 D              Asus4    Am
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Em               D                     A
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried

[prechorus]
D,C,D,C,Cadd9
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

[Chorus]
 
G,D,Em,C
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go 
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
G/B       Gm/Bb
Let the storm rage on
C
The cold never bothered me anyway

[verse 2]

G,  Dadd11/F#

Em                    C              D               Am
  It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
        Em              D                   Am           A
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all

D,C,D,C,Cadd9
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
    Cadd2
I'm free


[Chorus]

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on


[Bridge 2]

***short orchestration here***

C
My power flurries through the air into the ground
C7
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
D
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
E         Em              D               Am     C
I'm never going back, the past is in the past


[Chorus]

Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
