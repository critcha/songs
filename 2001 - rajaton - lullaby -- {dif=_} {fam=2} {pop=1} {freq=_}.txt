Sweet is the sound of my newborn wings
I stretch them open, and let them dry
I haven't seen this world before
But I'm excused, I'm a butterfly

Lailalai lai lai...

Sweet is the touch of your newborn wings
We fly in circles, we play with the sun
We haven't seen this world before
So fair, so bright, so blue the sky

Love me, love me on the leaves
Before we say goodbye
Love me, kiss me with the breeze
You will be my lullaby
To _ mor -- row I'll 
die, (tomorrow I'll die,) tomorrow I'll 
die, (tomorrow I'll die,) you'll be my 
lullaby, you'll _ be _ my lullaby...

Sweet is the wind as it gently blows
The day away, and the night time comes
Great are the wonders that silence shows
I fall asleep and I dream of the sun
