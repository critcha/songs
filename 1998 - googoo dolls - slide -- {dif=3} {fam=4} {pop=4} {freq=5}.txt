_ _ Could you whisper in my ear 
_ _ _ _ the things you wanna feel 
_ _ _ _ I'll give you anything 
_ _ _ _ To feel it comin' 

_ _ Do you wake up on your own 
_ _ _ _ And wonder where you are?
_ _ _ _ You live with all your faults...

Chorus: 
_ I wanna wake up where you are...
_ I won't say anything at all 
_ _ _ _ So why don't you 
slide... yeah slide

... yeah, we're gonna let it slyee-ide

Don't you love the life you killed?
The priest is on the phone,
your father hit the wall,
your ma disowned you

Don't suppose I'll ever know 
the means to be a man,
that's something I can just change,
or live around it

Chorus (repeat):
_ I wanna wake up where you are...
_ I won't say anything at all 
_ _ _ _ So why don't you 
slide... yeah slide

Bridge 1:
And I'll do anything you ever 
dreamed to be complete, little 
pieces of the nothing that fall, oh
May, _ put your arms around me, _ _ what you 
feel is what you are and what you are is beautiful, oh
May, _ you wanna get married, or run away?

Bridge (repeat):

Chorus (repeat):
