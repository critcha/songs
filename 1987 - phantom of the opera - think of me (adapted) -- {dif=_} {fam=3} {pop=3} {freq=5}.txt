[verse]
Think of me, think of me fondly,
when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while -
please promise me you'll try.

[chorus]
When you find that, once again, you long
to take your heart back and be free -
if you ever find a moment,
spare a thought for me ...

[verse]
Think of me, think of me waking,
silent and resigned.
Imagine me, trying too hard
to put you from my mind.

[chorus]
We never said our love was evergreen,
or as unchanging as the sea -
but if you can still remember,
stop and think of me ...
  
[bridge]
Think upon the things
we've shared and seen -
don't think about the things
which might have been ...

[chorus]
Recall those days, look back on all those times,
think of the things we'll never do -
there will never be a day, when
I won't think of you ...

[verse]
Raoul 
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?


[chorus]  
What a change! You're really not a bit
the gawkish girl that once you were ...
She may not remember me, but
I remember her ...
