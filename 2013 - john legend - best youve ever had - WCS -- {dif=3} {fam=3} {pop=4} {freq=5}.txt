Ain't this what you came for
Don't you wish you came more
Girl what you're playing for
Ah, come on

Come on, let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong, let me fix that
Twist that, Baby, 

Tonight's the night I let you know, baby, 
Tonight's the night we lose control, baby, 
Tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

I hit you with the best stroke,
Freestylin' the breaststroke
Til you're blowin' cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke

So what we gon' do now
... round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down, babe

(Chorus)
Tonight's the night I let you know, baby, 
Tonight's the night we lose control, baby, 
Tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

Okay, we started right
And I'm yours babe we got all night
And I won't waste your time
Baby tonight's the night, tonight's the night, baby


(Chorus)
Tonight's the night I let you know, baby, 
Tonight's the night we lose control, baby, 
Tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had


I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
