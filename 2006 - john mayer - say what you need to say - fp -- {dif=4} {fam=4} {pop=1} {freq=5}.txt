(Verse 1:)
Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems,
Better put 'em in quotations

(Chorus:)
Say what you need to say [8x]

(Verse 2:)
Walking like a one man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off (if) instead
If you could only . . .

(Chorus:)
Say what you need to say [8x]

(Bridge:)
[Am7,C9,D  x2]
[Am7,C,D,C,D]
Have no fear for giving over
Have no fear for giving in
You'd better know that in the end
It's better to say too much
Than never to say what you need to say again

(Verse 3:)
Even if your hands are shaking
And your faith is broken
Even if your eyes are closing
Say it with your heart wide open (a wide heart)

(Chorus:)
Say what you need to say [8x]
