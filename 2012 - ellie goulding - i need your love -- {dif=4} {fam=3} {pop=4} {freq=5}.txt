I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason... you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

{3               2
And I feel so helpless here...
Watch my eyes are filled with fear...
Tell me do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

[XoooXoooXoooooooo
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

[Melodic break; whistle

Am I dreaming? Will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong

And I feel so helpless here...
Watch my eyes are filled with fear...
Tell me do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing

(and all the tears)
All the lies, all the waste, 
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive

I need to be free...

[Chorus:
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
