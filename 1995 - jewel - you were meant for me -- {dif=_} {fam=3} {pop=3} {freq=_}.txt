:Verse 1:
[C+D,G_B+E,C+B,Em 
[C+D,G_B+E,C+B,D
_ I hear the clock, _ it's six A.M.
_ I feel so far _ from where I've been
_ I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too _, I
got my maple syrup, _ everything but you.

_ I break the yolks and make a smiley face
_ I kinda like it in my brand new place, I wipe the 
_ spots up off the meat, don't leave the keys in the door _, I 
never put wet towels _ on the floor anymore 'cause

:Chorus:
[C,D,G-D,Em x 2
[C,D,Em
_ Dreams last for _ so long,
_ even after you're gone, 
_ I know _ you love me, and
soon _ you will see, _ _ you were 
meant for me, _ _ _ and I _ was meant for you.

:Verse 2:

_ I called my mom and she was out for a walk _ con-
soled a cup of coffee _ _ but it 
didn't wanna talk, so I _ 
_ picked up the paper, it was more bad news, _ more 
hearts been broken, _ and people been used

_ Put on my coat in the pouring rain
_ I saw a movie it just wasn't the same, 'cause 
_ it was happy or _ I was sad, and 
_ it made me miss you _ oh so bad 'cause

::Chorus::

:Bridge:

[Am,D,Bm,Em
I 
go about my business, I'm 
_ doing fine, besides 
what would I say _ if I had 
_ you on the line?
_ Same old story, not 
_ much to say,
_ hearts are broken ev'ry day.

:Verse 3:

_ I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
_ I know you hate it _ when I leave the light on. _ I 
pick a book up and _ turn the sheets down and
take a deep breath _ and a good look around

_ Put on my pj's _ and hop into bed
_ I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead, I 
_ try and tell myself it'll all be alright, I 
_ shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause

::Chorus::

Yeah, you were meant for me and I was meant for you.
