only pretty sure _ _ that I can't take

for when I say out loud, _ I want to get out

_ der _ is there anything _ I'm 
gonna miss? _ _ I wonder

How it's going to be _ _ when you don't know
_ me _ _ _ _ _ _ 

How's it going to be _ when you're sure I'm
_ not there _ _ _ _ _
How's it going to be _ _ _ when there's no 
_ one there to talk to, be - 
tween you and me _ _ _ _ cause I 
_ don't care, _ how's it going to be?

... How's it going to be?

Where we used to laugh there's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammocks by the doorway we spent time in 
Swings empty, I don't see lightning like last fall when it was always
About to hit Me

I wonder how's it going to be when it goes down
Hows it going to be
When you're not around
Hows it going to be
When you've found out there was nothing
Between you and me
Cause I don't care
How's it going to be.
Hows it going to be
When you don't know me any more
And how's it going to be

Want to get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
Wanna taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion
Oblivion

How's it going to be
When you don't know me any more
How's it going to be
