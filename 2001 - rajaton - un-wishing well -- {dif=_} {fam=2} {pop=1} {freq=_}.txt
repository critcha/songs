I dropped a coin in a wishing well; I'd heard that's what you do
You drop a coin in a wishing well to make your wishes come true.
It must have been a real wishing well... what I wished for, I got.
I wished for love in that wishing well, and now I wish I had not.

Where's an un-wishing well? I have to break the spell!
Never again will I ever spend a penny on any well...

There has to be an un-wishing well, a magic to undo,
all the trouble I wished myself, the day that I wished for you.
And oh the trouble I wished myself, not every wish should come true.

There has to be an un-wishing well, there really has to be.
All foolish wishes could be dispelled and foolish lovers be free.
Free of the spell of some wishing well and free to love anew...
Free to be careful of wishing wells... not every wish should come true.

Where's that un-wishing well?
I need to break this spell 
of pain and heartache and the mistake of falling in love too well.

There has to be an un-wishing well, a magic to undo,
all the trouble I wished myself, the day that I wished for you.
And oh the trouble I wished myself, not every wish should come true.
Show me the way, and I'll gladly pay
to unwish unwise wishes far away.
