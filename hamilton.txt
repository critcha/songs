AARON BURR:
How does a
bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by Providence, impoverished, in
squalor.... Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

JOHN LAURENS:
The ten-dollar... Founding Father without a father got a
lot farther by workin’ a lot harder, by bein’ a
lot smarter, by bein’ a self-starter, by four-
teen... they placed him in charge of a trading charter

THOMAS JEFFERSON:
And
Every day while slaves... were Being slaughtered and carted a-
-way across the waves, he Struggled and kept his guard up, in-
-side, he was longing for Something to be a part of, The bro-
ther was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

JAMES MADISON:
Then a
hurricane came, .... and Devastation reigned, our
man saw his future drip, drippin’ down the drain, put a
pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain, and he
wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

BURR:
Well the
word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man!”,
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland,
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world’s gonna know your name! What’s your name, man?"

ALEXANDER HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton... my name is
Alexander Hamilton... And there’s a
million things I haven’t done... But just you
wait, just you wait...

ELIZA HAMILTON:
When he was
ten, his father split, full of it, debt-ridden, two years
... later, see Alex and his mother, bed-ridden Half-
dead... sittin’ in their own sick, the scent thick,

COMPANY:
 ... and
Alex got better but his mother went quick

GEORGE WASHINGTON and (COMPANY):
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin’ but ruined pride, somethin’ new inside, a
Voice saying "(Alex) you gotta fend for yourself", he started
Retreatin’ and readin’ every treatise on the shelf

BURR and (COMPANY):
There
would’ve been nothin’ left to do for someone less astute, he would’ve been
dead or destitute without a cent of restitution, started
workin’, clerkin’ for his late mother’s landlord
Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and other things he can’t afford
(Scammin’) for — every book he can get his hands on
(Plannin’) for the future, see him now – as he stands on (oooh) the
bow of a ship, headed For a new land, in
New York you can Be a new man

COMPANY and (HAMILTON):
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man

WOMEN:
In New York
MEN:
New York

HAMILTON:
Just you wait

COMPANY and (COMPANY):
Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time
Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

BURR and (COMPANY):
The ship is in the harbor now, see if you can spot him
(Just you wait)
Another immigrant comin’ up from the bottom
(Just you wait)
His enemies destroyed his rep, America forgot him

MULLIGAN/MADISON AND LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON:
We fought with him

LAURENS/PHILLIP:
Me? I died for him

WASHINGTON:
Me? I trusted him

ANGELICA SCHUYLER, ELIZA, MARIA REYNOLDS:
Me? I loved him

BURR:
And me? I’m the damn fool that shot him

COMPANY:
There’s a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait

BURR:
What’s your name, man?

HAMILTON & COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton!
