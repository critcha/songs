[Original in F# = C + capo

(Verse 1)
[C, Em, Am, C_G, F, G, C, Am-G
It was only a smile but my heart it went wild
I wasn't expecting that
Just a delicate kiss, anyone could've missed
I wasn't expecting that

Did I misread the sign?  Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't expecting that
You spent the night in my bed, You woke up and you said
"Well, I wasn't expecting that"

(Chorus 1)

[Dm,	Em - E, F - G,	C,	C - G
[Am,	Em,     F, 		G,	G

[    6  			5
.... I thought love wasn't 
[5       56423
meant to last,
[3                        4  3
_ I thought you were just passing 
[3
_ through

[6       6 5  6   5
... If I ever get the 
[676  5
nerve to ask  
[5                        6
_ What did I get right to deserve 
[5              2-1
_ somebody like you?
[5       4  3 2    1 
I wasn't expecting that

(Verse 2)
It was only a word, it was almost mis-heard
I wasn't expecting that
But it came without fear, a month turned into a year
I wasn't expecting that

(Chorus)
[Dm,	Em - E, F - G,	C,	C - G
[Am,	Em,     F, 		G,	G
I thought love wasn't meant to last,
Honey, I thought you were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that

(Bridge)
[G, G - E, Am, C_G]
[   5        5#   6
... Isn't it strange 
[   6   5 6    5      321
... how a life can be changed
[F, G, C, C-G_B]
[3                    5        2
In the flicker of the sweetest smile

[G, G - E, Am, C_G]
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
[F
Without that innocent kiss, 
[G
what a life I'd have missed

(Verse 3)
If you'd not took a chance on a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long, three kids up and gone
I wasn't expecting that
When the nurses they came, said it's come back again
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes, you took my heart by surprise
I wasn't expecting that!
