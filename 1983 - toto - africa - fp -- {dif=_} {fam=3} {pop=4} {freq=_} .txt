[Intro]
G (F#m)   Bm   x4

[Verse 1]
A                   C#m     F#m
I hear the drums echoing tonight
A                 G             Bm          F#m   G  Bm
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion
A                C#m           F#m          A
She's coming in twelve thirty flight   the moonlit wings
G                      Bm7               F#m   G  Bm
Reflect the stars that guide me toward salva-tion
A              C#m             F#m
I stopped an old man along the way
A                    G             Bm               F#m   G Bm
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melo-dies
A              C#m       F#m                 G                Bm
He turned to me as if to say hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

[Chorus]
Em            C               G       D
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                      C             G             D
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Em           C           G  D
I bless the rains down in  Africa
Em              C               G        Bm  D Em   G Bm
Gonna take some time to do the things we never  had

[Verse 2]
A             C#m            F#m
The wild dogs cry out in the night
A                     G                Bm       F#m   G  Bm
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
A           C#m              F#m
I know that I must do what's right
A                      G          Bm                F#m    G  Bm
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
A         C#m                F#m
I seek to cure what's deep inside
F#m                G                   Bm [+4]
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus]
Em           C                G       D
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                     C             G               D
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Em          C              G    D
I bless the rains down in  Africa
Em              C              G                Bm  D Em(D_F#)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never  had

[Bridge]
A  C#7  F#m              G              Bm
          hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

[Outro/Chorus]
Em          C             G       D
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                    C             G             D
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Em         C             G  D
I bless the rains down in  Africa [x 5]


[Outro]
