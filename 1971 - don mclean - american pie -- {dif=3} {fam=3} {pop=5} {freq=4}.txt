[Intro, slow]
[A verse 0]
G,D,Em,Am,C,Em,D
A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that 
Music used to make me smile

[A'(C) verse 0]
G,D,Em,Am,C,Em,(*C* first/last time, else A),D
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

[B verse 0]
Em,Am,Em,Am
C,Bm,Am,C,D
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

[C verse 0]
G,D,Em,C,D
G,D,Em,C,D,G
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus:]
[G,C,G,D]*3
Em,A,Em,D
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[D verse 1]
G,Am,C,Am,Em,D
d   e   d     b   c       c-b
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
Cause the Bible tells you so?
 
[A'(A) verse 1]
e   d  e-d d  d-b     d        e
Now do ou believe in rock and roll
   (d  b  d    c    b   a  c
Can music save your mortal soul
                      (b   b  a)  
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

[B verse 1]
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

[C verse 1]
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

[Chorus]
I started singin'
Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[D verse 2]
Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be

[A'(A) verse 2]
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

[B verse 2]
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
[b a   g         e  d]  
No verdict was returned

[C verse 2]
And while Lenin read a book on Marx
A quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry 
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[D verse 3]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

[A'(A) verse 3]
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

[B verse 3]
                        (g)
Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
                           (b-a a  g)			
We all got up to dance, Oh, but we 
 (b   a g-e  e  e-d 
- never got the chance

[C verse 3]
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

[Chorus]
We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[D verse 4]
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

[A'(A) verse 4]
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

[B verse 4]
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

[C verse 4]
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

[Chorus]
He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Outro, slow]
[A verse]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

[A'(C) verse]
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
Em,*C*,D
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

[B verse]
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

[C verse]
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

[Chorus]
And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Chorus]
They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die"
