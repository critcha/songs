[Em, B7, C, G,
Called my brother, yelling out
I fell in love and then fell out
And I don’t know if I can take the hit
I let a stranger in my bed
But it was you up in my head
Cause I needed to feel wanted

But
I _ gotta,
_ oh I _ gotta find another way, _ _ another way
Yeah
I _ gotta,
_ oh I _ gotta find another way, _ _ another way

I’m learning to live
_ _ _ I’m trying to be better
_ _ _ I’m learning to give
_ _ _ But I don’t know if I’m a giver

Every day’s another shot
To fuck up everything I got,
Screaming cause I’ve got it too good to cry.
I put the medicine inside my head
Apologize for all the things I said,
'Cause it takes guts to just survive

I gotta oh, I gotta find another way
I’m learning to live
I’m trying to be better
I’m learning to give
But I don’t know if I’m a giver

I got so much soul in my body
But no one keeping me honest
And whole days turn into holes in my mind
I got high hopes lots of potential
I’m high, broke, searching for symbols
And I will not let go of what is mine
