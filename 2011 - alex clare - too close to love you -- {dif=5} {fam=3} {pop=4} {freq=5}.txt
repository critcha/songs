[3  5    6       1   6 ^3     2  1 6 
You know I'm not one to break promises,
[3 6            1    6        ^1    6            
I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe.
[3     5   6     1-6  6           ^3  2-1  6       
At the end of it all, you're still my best friend,
[3          5    6      1    2    1 232  2  1    6     
But there's something inside that I need to release.
[5    6      1      5     6   5  6 
Which way is right, which way is wrong,
[5  6       ^3   ^4^53   32 2--1 16
How do I say that I need to move on?
[6  32   21    32 21   32  21   21  12    76
You know we're heading separate way-heyee-ay-s.

[Am,C,D=C+2,F

And it feels like I am just too close to love you,
There is nothing I can really say.
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more,
Got to be true to myself.
And it feels like I am just too close to love you,
So I'll be on my way.

[3     5  6     1       5    6    ^3 216
You've given me more... than I can return,
[3          5   6  1    2-1  2   2 1-6
Yet there's all so much that you deserve.

There's nothing to say, nothing to do.
I've nothing to give,
I must live without you.
You know we're heading separate ways.
