[Em7 (D_F#), G, C9,
Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

(verse 1)
[Em7 (D_F#), G, C9, _ (D)
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

(chorus 1)
Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

(verse 2)
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

(chorus 2)
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

(verse 3)
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

(chorus 3)
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

(verse 4 [half])
Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

(verse 5)
I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years
old, my daddy got sixty-
one, remember life and then your
life becomes a better one
_ I made a man so happy
When I wrote a letter once
_ I hope my children come and
visit once or twice a month

[C (D), Em, D, G_B, D_F#
[C (D), Em, C, _ (D)
Soon I'll be sixty years
old, will I think the world is
colder, will I have a lot of
children who can warm me,
soon I'll be sixty years
old

(Chorus)

[Em (D), G, C9, _ (D)
Soon I'll be sixty years
old, will I think the world is
colder, will I have a lot of
children who can warm me,
soon I'll be sixty years
old

Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old
