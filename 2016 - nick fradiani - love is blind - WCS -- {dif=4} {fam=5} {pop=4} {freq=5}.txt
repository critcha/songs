I've never lived a simple life
I just got one confession
With you I start to question
Every single thing I thought was right
I may never learn my lesson
But you are my only heaven
You and me
Is everything I need
It's everything I want
But I want to believe

(Chorus)
That when they say love is blind
That I see it
Every time you smile
When they say only fools rush in
That I may be foolish to know what forever is

(Verse 2)
I know love can be a scary thing
But you are more than worth it
Girl I ain't even nervous
Your touch it makes the fire burn
And now that this fires rolling
I keep on wantin' more of
You and me
Cause its everything I need
Its everything I want
And I want to believe

(Chorus)
That when they say love is blind
That I see
Everytime you smile
When they say only fools rush in
That I may be foolish to know what forever is

Whoah...


I've never lived a simple life
But you are my only heaven
You are my only

So when they said love is blind
That I see
Everytime you smile
When they say only fools rush in
Then I may be foolish
To know what forever is
