Em,C,Am,B7

Your subleties
They strangle me
I can't ex	plain myself at all
And all the wants
And all the needs
That I don't want to need at all

Pre Chorus:

C,G
The walls start breathing
My minds unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone

C,Bm,Am,D
A weight is li	fted
On this e	vening
I give the 	final blow

G	C Em D
When 	darkness turns to light
It ends tonight
It ends tonight

[Em C Am B7] x2
A falling star
Lest I fall alone
I can't explain what you can't explain
You're finding things
That you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain

Pre Chorus:

Chorus:

[G C Em D] x2
When 	darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, It ends tonight
Just a little in	sight Won't make this right
It's too late to fight
It ends tonight

It ends tonight

Bridge:

[Em D A C] x2
Now that I'm on my own side
It's better than 	being on your side
I's my fault when you're bli	nd
It's better that I 	see through your eyes

Bm C Am7 D
All these 	thoughts locked insi	de
Now you're the 	first to know

[G C Em D] x2
When 	darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, It ends tonight
Just a little in	sight Won't make this right
It's too late to fight
It ends tonight

It ends tonight
