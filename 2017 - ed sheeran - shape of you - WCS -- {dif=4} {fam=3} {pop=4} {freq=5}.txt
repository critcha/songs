The 
club isn't the best place to find a lover, so the 
bar is where I go.
Me and my friends at the table doing shots, drinking 
fast and then we talk slow (mmmm) _ You come 

over and start up a conversation with just me, and 
trust me I'll give it a chance _ now, take my 
hand, stop you band on the jukebox, and 
then we start to dance, _ and now I'm singing like

(Pre-chorus 1)
Girl, you know I want your love,
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me, say

Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

(Chorus)
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in, we let the story begin, we're going 
out _ on _ our first date (mmmm), you and 
me _ are thrifty, so it's all you can eat, fill up your 
bag and I fill up a plate.  _ We talk for 
hours and hours about the sweet and tsour, and how your 
family is doing okay.  Leave and 
get in a taxi, _ then kiss in the backseat, tell the 
driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

(Pre-chorus 2)
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead


(Chorus) 
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
