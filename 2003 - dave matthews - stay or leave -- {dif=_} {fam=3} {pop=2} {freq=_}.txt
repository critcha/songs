[Play in original Bm

(Verse 1)
[Bm,D,A,G,D,_,A,_
Maybe different but remember
Winters warm where you and i
Kissing whiskey by the fire 
With the snow outside

And when the summer comes and the river
Swims at midnight, shiver cold
Touch the bottom, you and I
With muddy toes

(Chorus)
[Dm,F,C,G
_ Stay or leave, I 
want you not to go, but you 
should, _ it was good as 
good _ goes

Stay or leave, I 
want you not to go, but you 
did

(Verse 2)
Wake up naked drinking coffee
Making plans to change the world
While the world is changing us
Was good good enough

You used to laugh under the covers
Maybe not so often now
But the way I used to laugh with you
Was loud and hard

(Chorus 2)
_ Stay or leave, I 
want you not to go, but you 
should, _ it was good as 
good _ goes

Stay or leave, I 
want you not to go, but you
