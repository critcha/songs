And 
I ... will stumble and

And 
I... will swallow my 
pride, ... you're the one 
_ that I love, and I'm saying good-
bye

Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere I would've followed you (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Say something, I'm giving up on you

(Quiet)

Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something...
