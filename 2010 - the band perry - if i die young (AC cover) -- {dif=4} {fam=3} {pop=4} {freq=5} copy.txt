If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in a river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Uh oh, uh oh

Lord make me a 
Rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother, she'll know I'm safe with 
you when she stands under my colors, oh, and..
_ Life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life... well
I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life... well
I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing 
white _ _ when I come into your kingdom.  I'm as 
green as the ring on my little cold finger, I've... 
... ne...ver known the lovin' of a man, but it 
Sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand, there's a 
Boy here in town, says he'll love me forever,
Who would have thought forever could be severed by...

...the sharp knife of a short life, well...
I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls

What I never did is done

A penny for my 
thoughts, oh, no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar,
they're worth so much more after I'm a goner, and 
maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin',
funny when you're dead how people start listenin'....

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket

Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh
