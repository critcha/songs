Fm = Em + capp

[Arrangement:]
[Em+G,C+BG,D+BG]

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing

They say be afraid
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

CHORUS 
{
[C,D,Am,Em]
[C,D,Am,B]
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

[C+G,D+G,Em+G,G]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
}

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

+ [CHORUS]

Am,C,Em,D
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star


I wanna work on your wavelength
I wanna feel it when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all

B7
Oh, oh

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
