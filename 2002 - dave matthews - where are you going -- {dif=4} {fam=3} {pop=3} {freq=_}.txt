[Play in original D


Where are you going, with your long face pulling down? Don’t hide away,
Like an ocean, but you can’t see, but you can smell, and the sound, waves crash 
down

I am no superman
I have no reasons for you
I am no hero, oh that’s for sure
But I do know one thing
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go, is where I want to be

Where are you going, 
... where do you go?
Are you looking for answers, to questions under the stars? Well if along the way 
you are grown weary, you can rest with me until a brighter day and you're okay, 

I am no superman
I have no answers for you
I am no hero, oh that’s for sure
But I do know one thing
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go, is where I want to be

Where are you going  
... where do you go?

Are you looking for answers, where do you go?

Where are you going?
Where do you go?
Let’s go.
