[D,C9,G
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone 
Turned on some music to start my day 
I lost myself in a familiar song 
I closed my eyes and I slipped away 

[Am,G,D
[G,C,Em,D
It's more than a feeling 
(More than a feeling) 
When I hear that old song they used to play 
(More than a feeling) 
I begin dreaming 
(More than a feeling) 
[G,C,Eb
'Til I see Marianne walk away 
[Em,A,G,G-D-A-D
I see my Marianne walkin' away 

So many people have come and gone 
Their faces fade as the years go by 
Yet I still recall as I wander on 
As clear as the sun in the summer sky 
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/boston/more+than+a+feeling_20023066.html ]
It's more than a feeling 
(More than a feeling) 
When I hear that old song they used to play 
(More than a feeling) 
I begin dreaming 
(More than a feeling) 
'Til I see Marianne walk away 

[Em7,A,Bm,A,G,D,Asus4,A
I see my Marianne walkin' away 

[Whistle guitar solo:
[D,G,Bm,A x 3
[D,G,Em,A,G,G-D-A-D

When I'm tired and thinking cold 
I hide in my music, forget the day 
And dream of a girl I used to know 
I closed my eyes and she slipped away 
[D,a-b-C,G(b-g) x 3
[D,a-b-C,G(b)
              d
She slipped away 

[a ^f# ^g
Away


[Am,G,D
[G,C,Em,D
It's more than a feeling 
(More than a feeling) 
When I hear that old song they used to play 
(More than a feeling) 
I begin dreaming 
(More than a feeling)
