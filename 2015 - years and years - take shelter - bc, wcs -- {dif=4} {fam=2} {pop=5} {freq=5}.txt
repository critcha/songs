[Bm, _ , A, _, F#5, _ Em
_ Just tell me what I have to do,
_ To keep myself apart from you

_ I know I wanted far too much,
_ Then I thought that wouldn’t be enough
All this talk is clos-
_ing you.

(Chorus)
[Bm, D, Em, A 
Take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it’s alright,
If you want to get used,
You get used!

Take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it’s alright,
If you want to get used,
Then get used!

(Verse 2)
_ I don’t really wanna stop myself
_Nobody’s gonna tell me I need help,
_ Are you _ com-
ing over soon?

_ I'll meet you at the darkest time
_ You hold me, and I have to shut my 
_ eyes, _ I’m shy, can-
_ not be what you like.

(You go down, to reach my top anyway
You go down, reach my top anyway)

(Prechous)
[Bm, _ , A, _, F#5, _ Em
_ Just tell me what I have to do,
_ To keep myself apart from you
All your colors _ start

And take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it’s alright,
If you want to get used,
Then get used!

Take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it’s alright,
If you want to get used,
Then get used!

Then get used!

If you want to get used!
