Original = Dm, maybe play in Em to avoid Bb??

Dm, F, C, Gm, x2
I let it fall, _ _ _ my heart, _ _ and as it 
fell, _ you rose to claim _ it, _ _ _ it was 
dark _ _ and it was over, _ _ until you 
kissed my lips _ _ and you saved me

My hands, _ _ _ they were strong, _ _ But my 
knees _ were far too weak _ _ _ To 
stand _ _ in your arms _ _ _ Without fall 
_ ing to your feet _ _ _

Bb,Gm,Dm,(Dm),
Bb, C
But there's a 
side _ to you that I never knew, never knew, all the 
things _ you'd say, they were never true, never true, and the 
games _ you'd play, you would always win, always win 

Dm (-F), C (-Am), (Bb -) Gm, Dm-C,
But I set 
fire _ _ to the rain, _ _ watched it 
pour _ as I touched your face, _ _ let it 
burn while I cried, 'cause I heard it screaming out your 
name, _ _ _ your name

When I 
lay _ _ _ with you, _ _ I could 
stay _ there, _ close my eyes, _ _ _ feel you 
here _ _, forever, _ _ you and 
me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a 
side _ to you that I never knew, never knew, all the 
things _ you'd say, they were never true, never true, and the 
games _ you'd play, you would always win, always win 

But I set 
fire _ _ to the rain, _ _ watched it 
pour _ as I touched your face, _ _ let it 
burn while I cried, 'cause I heard it screaming out your 
name, _ _ your name

I set 
fire _ _ to the rain, _ _ and I threw 
us _ into the flames, _ _ when it fell 
_ somethin' died, _ 'cause I knew _ that _ that _ was the last 
Bb,C
time, _ _ the last time

Bb,F,Am,C x2
Sometimes I 
_ wake _ up by the door, _ _ that heart you
caught _ must be wait - in' for you, _ _ even now 
_ when we're already over, _ _ I can't help 
_ myself from loo - king for _ ya

I set
fire _ _ to the rain, _ _ watched it 
pour _ as I touched your face, _ _ let it 
burn while I cried, 'cause I heard it screaming out your 
name, _ _ your name

I set 
fire _ _ to the rain, _ _ and I threw 
us _ into the flames, _ _ when it fell 
_ somethin' died, _ 'cause I knew _ that _ that _ was the last 
Bb,C
time, _ _ the last time, Oh...
