There's a _ fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
Final - ly, I can see you crystal clear,
Go 'head _ and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare,
See how _ I'll leave with every piece of you,
Don't un - derestimate the things that I will do.
There's a _ fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
