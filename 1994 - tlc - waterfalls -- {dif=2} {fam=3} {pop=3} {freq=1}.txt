... A lonely mother gazing out of her win - dow, staring 
[7b      8    6   5    4                     6     7
at a son that she just can't touch.  _ _ _ _ If at any 
[8                  
time he's in a jam, _ she'll be by his side, _ but he doesn't 
realize he hurts her so much _ _ _ _ 

[3
_ But all the praying just ain't helping at all, _ 'cause he can't 
seem to keep his self out of trou - ble. _ _ So he goes out 
and he makes his money the best way he knows how, _ another 
body laying cold in the gu - tter, _ listen to me...

[Chorus:]
[8
Don't go chasing waterfalls, please stick to the 
rivers and the lakes that you're used to... I know that you're 
gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're 
moving too fast

_ _ Little precious has a natural obsession for temp-
tation but he just can't see
[8
_ She gives him loving that his body can't handle, but all 
he can say is "Baby, it's good to me."

[3
_ One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mi - rror, but he 
doesn't recognize his own face
[3
_ His health is fading and he doesn't know why, _ three letters 
took him to his fi - nal resting place. _ Y'all don't hear me

[Chorus]

Come on

[Rap]

_ I seen a rainbow _ yesterday, _ but too many storms 
_ have come and gone leavin' a trace of not one God - given 
ray.  Is it because my life is ten _ shades of gray I pray all 
ten _ fade away?  _ Seldom praise Him for the sunny days. _ 

_ and like His promise is true _ only my faith can undo
_ the many chances I blew _ to bring my life to anew.
_ _ Clear blue and unconditional skies _ have dried the 
tears from my eyes, _ no more lonely cries. _ _ _ _ My

only bleedin' hope is for the folk who can't _ cope with such an 
endurin' pain _ _ that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain. _ 
_ _ Who's to blame for tootin' 'caine into your own _ vein
_ _ What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain.  You 

claim the insane, _ _  name this day and time for fallin' prey to 
crime, I say the system got you victim to your own _ mind.
_ _ Dreams are hopeless aspirations _ in hopes of comin' 
true. Believe in yourself _ the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus]
