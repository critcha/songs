_ _ Sayin' I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
_ _ It's not that I want you
Not to say it, but if you only knew
_ _ How _ eas_y 
It would be to show me how you feel,

    What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

[Verse 2:]
_ _ Now that I've tried _ to 
talk to you and make you understand,
_ _ all you have to do is close 
_ your eyes and just reach out your hands 
_ _ and _ touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

need-ed you to show, _ then you 
wouldn't have to say _ _ that you love _  me, 
_ _ _ cause I'd _ al_read_y _ 
know

[Chorus:]
     What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
