Although 
loneliness has always been a friend of mine, I'm 
leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind,
Risking it all in a glance... And 
how you got me blind is still a mystery, I 
can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history, As 
long as you're here with me

[C,G,Em,D
I don't care who you are, Where you're from
What you did, As long as you love me
Who you are, Where you're from
Don't care what you did, As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
feels like it's deep within me.... it
doesn't really matter if you're on the run, it
seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)

Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)
