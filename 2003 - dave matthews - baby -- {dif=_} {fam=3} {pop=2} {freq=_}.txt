[AC cover, written Dec 25, 2020]

Baby, it's alright
I hear you crying
Now

Not everything's here to stay
Somethings will have to begin and end
A ship in a bottle won't sail
But what we can do is
Dream that the wind will blow us across the water
A ship in a bottle sets sail

Baby, it's alright
That you're crying, now

There was a weakling man
Who dreamed he was strong as a hurricane
A ship in a bottle set sail
He took a deep breath and blew across the world
He watched everything crumble
And woke up a weakling again

[BRIDGE]
[Bm, A, D, G, Bm, A, D, G, Dsus4]
Some might tell you there's no hope in hell
Just because they feel hopeless
But you don't have to fear a thing like that
You be a ship in a bottle set sail

[VERSE
There was a lonely girl
Who dreamed something she could bring to the world
A ship in a bottle set sail
She gather her heart
Gave what she could, she worked every day harder,
And wondered if it was enough

[BRIDGE]
[Plucked: Bm, ...
I can tell you that you are my dream
And I think I know that now
But you are more than dreaming eyes can see
When you're a ship in a bottle set sail

I know I don't ful-ly understand
... What the pain feels like for you, still I know,
You don't have to feel a thing like that
Cause you're a ship in a bottle set sail

Baby, it's alright... if you...
Stop your crying, now
It's alright, you can
Stop your crying, now
Be a ship in a bottle set sail
