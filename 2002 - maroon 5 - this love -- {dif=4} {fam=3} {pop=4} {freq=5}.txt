Original in Cm = Am + capo, also best to sing

E,Am,Dm,E
I was so high I didn't recognize
the fire burning in her eyes, the chaos that controlled my mind....
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again but always in my heart

Chorus:

Am,Dm,G,C (-G)
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
Am,D,F,E
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore


Verse 2:

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore

Bridge:

 Dm
I'll fix these broken things
  C
Repair your broken wings
E7                          Am  
And make sure everything's alright
Dm
My pressure on your hips
C
Sinking my fingertips
E
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore
