[f#ef# a  b f#eb]
I ---- know a girl

[b  d    e   f#ed  d  a   f# ef# ef#  ] 
She puts the color inside of my  world

[   f#   ^b    ef#   e f#eb
But she's just like a maze

[b    g   f# e   g     f#  e  g  f# ef# ef#]
Where all of the walls all continually change

And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see ... may - 
be it's got nothing to do with me

Bm,E7,A+GD,D
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

G,Gm,D
Boys, you can break
D+C#,D+C#E
You'll find out how much they can 

Bm+E
take, boys will be 
Asus4-A
strong, and boys soldier 
D
on, but boys would be 
C
gone without warmth from

A		  A6	A7
(d a  e    f#    g    g-f#)
A woman's good, good heart

Bm,E7,A+DG,D

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the god and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Bm,E7,C,D
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too [x3]
