I was stained, with a role, in a day and not my own 
But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown 
And I always knew what was right, I just didn't know that I might 
Peel away and choose to see with such indifferent sight 

[Chorus]
And I will never see the sky the same way, and
I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday, and 
I will never cease to fly if held down, and 
I will always reach too high cause I've seen, cause I've seen, twilight... 

[Verse 2]
Never cared, never wanted 
Never sought to see what flaunted 
So on purpose, so in my face, couldn't see beyond my own place 
And it was so easy not to behold what I could hold 
But you taught me I could change whatever came within these shallow days 

[Chorus]
And I will never see the sky the same way, and 
I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday, and 
I will never cease to fly if held down, and 
I will always reach too high cause I've seen, cause I've seen

[Bridge]
As the sun shines through it pushes away and pushes ahead 
It fills the warmth of blue and leaves a chill instead and 
I didn't know that I could be so blind to all that is so real 
But as illusion dies I see there is so much to be revealed 

[Chorus]
And I will never see the sky the same way, and 
I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday, and 
I will never cease to fly if held down, and 
I will always reach too high cause I've seen, cause I've seen, twilight 

[Verse 3]
I was stained, by a role, in a day not my own 
But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown 
And I always knew, what was right
I just didn't know that I might 
Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight 

[Chorus]
And I will never see the sky the same way, and 
I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday, and 
I will never cease to fly if held down, and 
I will always reach too high cause I've seen, cause I've seen, twilight...
