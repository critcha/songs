[Original in  G, somewhat arranged

The lights in the harbor,
Don't shine for me.
I'm like a lost ship,
Adrift on the sea.

[G,D-D7,G-G7,C-(Cm),G,D
The sea of heartbreak, 
lost love and loneliness,
Memories of your caress.
So divine how I wish
You were mine again my dear.
I'm on this sea of tears,
The sea of heartbreak.

Oh, how did I lose you?
Oh, where did I fail?
Why did you leave me?
Always to sail,

The sea of heartbreak.
Lost love and loneliness,
Memories of your caress.
So divine how I wish
You were mine again my dear.
I'm on this sea of tears,
The sea of heartbreak.

Oh, what I'd give -- to sail back to shore,

(g                ag   b   )
Back to your arms once more.

Come to my rescue, oh, come here to me.
Take me and keep me away from the sea.

Sea of heartbreak.
Lost love and loneliness,
Memories of your caress.
So divine how I wish
You were mine again my dear.
I'm on this sea of tears,
The sea of heartbreak.

Sea of heartbreak.
Sea of heartbreak.
Sea of heartbreak.
