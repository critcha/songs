(Verse 1:)
[G,D,G,D,Em,D,C,D]
My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says "Boy quit foolin' around"
...I told her 

"I love the view from up here
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love"

(Chorus:)
[C,G,C,G,|B7,Em,D,C,D]
We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine, all mine
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love

(Verse 2:)
My heart beats like a drum,
A guitar string to the strum,
A beautiful song to be sung
... She's got 

blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

(Chorus:)
We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love

(Bridge:)
[|B7,C,G,D x2
[C,D,C,D]
When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will dry
All your tears will subside

(Verse 3:)
Bapba (Bapba) Datda x 3
Da... dadadum... dadadum...

Bapba (Bapba) Datba x 3
Ba... dadadum... dadadum...

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
Yes sway to the rhythm of love
