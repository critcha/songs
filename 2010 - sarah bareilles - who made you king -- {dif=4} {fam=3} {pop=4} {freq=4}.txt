Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

Keep drinkin' coffee, stare me 
down across the table
While I look outside

So many things I'd say if 
only I were able But I 
just keep quiet
And count the cars that pass by

You've got opinions, yeah
We're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked

So let me thank you for your time
And try to not waste any more of mine
Get out of here fast

Dm,Em,F,Am,G
I hate to break it to you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Am,F,C, G
Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?

Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

You sound so innocent
All full of good intent
You swear you know best

But you expect me to
Jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset

I'm not the one who's lost
With no direction oh
But you'll never see

You're so busy makin' maps
With my name on them in all caps
You've got the talkin' down
Just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?

Dm,Em,F,G,C
(c c    d   e    f  e  d    c  c   e    g)
Waitin' for someone to tell me it's my turn
To decide.

Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me.
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be.
Who died and made you king of anything?

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me.
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be.
Who died and made you king of anything?

Let me hold your crown, babe.
Oh ohhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
