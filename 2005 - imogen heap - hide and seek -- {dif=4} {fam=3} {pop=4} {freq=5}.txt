where are we?  what the hell is 
going on? the dust has only 
just begun to form crop circles in the carpet, 
sinking feeling

spin me round again and rub my eyes, 
this can't be happening, when 
busy streets a-mess with people would stop to hold 
their heads heavy

hide and seek
trains and sewing machines
all those years
they were here first

oily marks appear on walls where 
pleasure moments hung before the 
takeover, the sweeping insensitivity 
of this still life

hide and seek
trains and sewing machines (oh, you won't catch me around here)
blood and tears (hearts)
they were here first

Mmmm whatchya say,
Mmm that you only meant well?
well of course you did
Mmmm whatcha say,
Mmmm that it's all for the best?
of course it is
Mmmm whatcha say?
Mmmm that it's just what we need
you decided this
whatcha say?
Mmmm what did you say?

ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut outs
speak no feeling no I don't believe you
you don't care a bit, 
you don't care a bit
