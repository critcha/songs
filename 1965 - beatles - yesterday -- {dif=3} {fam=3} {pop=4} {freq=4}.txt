Yesterday... all my troubles seemed so far away
now I need a place to hide away oh I belive in yesterday

Suddenly... I'm not half the man I used to be 
there's a shadow hanging over me oh I belive in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said some thing wrong now I long for yesterday

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play 
now I need a place to hide away oh I belive in yesterday
