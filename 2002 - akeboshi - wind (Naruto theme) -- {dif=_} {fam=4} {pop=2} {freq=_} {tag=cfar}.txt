Cultivate your hunger before you idealize.
Motivate your anger to make them all realize.
Climbing the mountain, never coming down.
Break into the contents, never falling down.

My knee is still shaking, like I was twelve, 
Sneaking out the classroom, by the back door.
A man yelled at me twice, but I didn't care.
Waiting is wasting for people like me.

Don't try to look so wise.
Don't cry 'cause you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears, 
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.

(Repeats)

Dm,Em,Am,G
You say, "a dream's a dream,
"I ain't gonna play the fool...
... anymore."
Dm,Em,G
You say, "'Cause I still got my soul."

Take your time, baby, your blood needs slowing down.
Breach your soul to reach yourself before you gloom.
(Re)flection of fear makes shadow of nothing, shadow of nothing.




[soft]
Still you are blind, if you see a winding road, 
'Cause there's always a straight way to the point you see.

Don't try to look so wise.
Don't cry 'cause you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears, 
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.
