_ You took my hand, _ you showed me how
_ You promised me _ you'd be around
_ _ _ Uh huh _ _ that's right 

_ I took your words _ And I believed
_ in everything _ you said to me
_ _ _ Yeah huh _ _ that's right

If 
someone said three years from now
_ _ _ you'd be long gone, I'd 
stand up and punch them out
_ _ _ cause they're all wrong
_ _ I know _ _ better
_ _ cause you said forever
_ and ever, _ _ who knew

_ Remember when _ we were such fools
_ and so convinced _ and just too cool
_ _ _ Oh no _ _ no no

_ I wish I could _ touch you again
_ I wish I could _ still call you friend
_ _ _ I'd give _ _ anything

When 
someone said count your blessings now
_ _ _ 'fore they're long gone, I 
guess I just didn't know how
_ _ _ I was all wrong
_ _ They knew _ _ better
_ _ still you said forever
_ and ever, _ _ who knew

_ and I won't forget you my friend
_ What happened 

If

_ That last kiss _ I'll cherish
_ Until we meet again
_ And time makes _ tt harder
