[Original in C, play in G

(Verse 1)

[G,D,Em,C
I hate you, I love you, I just can't remember to forget you.  
Who are you, who needs you? You make me feel alive, 
I die, so high I'm crawling on the ground and 
I've found I can fly

(Pre-chorus)

[C+B,D,C+B,D
One of these days it all comes together
One of those days that goes on forever
Think I sounds crazy? Maybe, whatever
What's it all about?

(Chorus:)
[Down octave?]
[1234567812345678
[X   X  oX X  O
It's about life, it's about fun
It's over before it has begun
It's about you, it's about me
It's about everything between and I say
I'm saying goodbye to you, I say hi to you with no clue
[Em,D,A
It's about time that I
Make up my mind 

(Verse 2)

It's simple, confusing, the truth is I'm winning but I'm losing
And pulling and pushing won't do me any good
It could, it should, I'm honest to myself that 
The truth is I lied 

(Pre-chorus)

One of these days it all comes together
One of those days that goes on forever
Think it sounds crazy? Maybe, whatever
What's it all about? 

(Chorus)

It's about life, it's about fun
It's over before it has begun
It's about you, it's about me
It's about everything between and I say
I'm saying goodbye to you, I say hi to you with no clue
[Em,D,A
It's about time that I
Make up my mind 

(Bridge)

[G,D,F,C
Time is creeping behind me, surrounding around me
Fading the words so desperately
Now give me a reason that I can believe in
Time is something you can rewind...

(Pre-chorus)

One of these days it all comes together
One of those days that goes on forever
Think I sound crazy? Maybe, whatever
What's it all about? 

((Skip chorus to ending, it's more fun))

It's about life, it's about fun, it's about you, it's about me
It's about life, it's about fun, it's about you, it's about me
...and I say
(It's about life, it's about fun, it's about you, it's about me)
I'm saying goodbye to you, I say hi to you with no clue
[Am,G,D
It's about time that I
Make up my mind
