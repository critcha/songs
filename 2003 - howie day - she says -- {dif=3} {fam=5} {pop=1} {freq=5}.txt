(Verse 1)

Sweet is the sight
Of her room
Window opened by candlelight
How would you know
Cold winter on the shore
Chills the dress she wore
It's on the floor
Still it feels so warm today

(Pre chorus)

And that's why I'm wondering why
You had to tell me
What's going on in your head
What's wrong
Come around to another time when you
Wouldn't have to run

(Chorus)

And when she says she wants somebody else
I hope you know that's she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and makes a sound
You'll never hear her the way that I do
And when she says she wants someone to love
I hope you know that she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and lets you down
I hope you know that she doesn't mean to

(1.5 bar instrumental)

(Verse 2)

I swing into flight
Over hills.
Over her hills, it's twilight
I guess that's right now
While we're here
Tell me why it's so funny
That you're so funny
When you're mad
Always so mad. So mad

(Pre-Chorus)

And that's why I'm wondering why
You had to tell me
What's going on in your head
What's wrong
Come around to another time when you
Wouldn't have to run

(Chorus)

And when she says she wants somebody else
I hope you know that's she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and makes a sound
You'll never hear her the way that I do
And when she says she wants someone to love
I hope you know that she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and lets you down
I hope you know that she doesn't mean to

she doesn't mean you

(Bridge)

Well, I don't know where I'm comin' from
and I don't know where I'm comin to, 
and I don't know what it means to me
and you don't know what it means to you

she doesn't mean you
