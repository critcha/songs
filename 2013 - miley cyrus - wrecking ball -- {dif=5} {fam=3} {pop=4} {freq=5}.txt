[a d a d a c a c..
We 
clawed, we chained our hearts in vain, we jumped 
_ _ never asking why _ _ we 
kissed, I fell under your spell, a love 
_ _ no one could deny

(Pre-chorus)

[Bb,Dm,F,Bb x2
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

(Chorus)

[F,C,Dm,Bb x2, Dm,Bb
... I came in like a 
wrecking ball _ _ _ I never hit so 
hard in love _ _ all I wanted was to 
break your walls _ _ all you ever did was 
_ _ wreck _ me _ _ yeah you
_ , you wreck _ me

(Verse 2)

[Dm,F,Am,Bb x2
I 
put you high up in the sky and now, 
_ _ you're not coming down _ _ it 
slowly turned, you let me burn and now
_ , we're ashes on the ground

(Pre-chorus)

[Bb,Dm,F,Bb x2
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

(Chorus)

... I came in like a 
wrecking ball _ _ _ I never hit so 
hard in love _ _ all I wanted was to 
break your walls _ _ all you ever did was 
_ _ wreck _ me

... I never meant to 
start a war _ _ I just wanted you to 
let me in _ _ _ but instead of us -
_ ing force _ _ _ I guess I should've 
let you win _ _ _
