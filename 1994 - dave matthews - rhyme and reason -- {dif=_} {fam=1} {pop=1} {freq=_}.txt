Oh well oh well so here we stand 
But we stand for nothing 
My heart calls to me in my sleep 
How can I turn to it 
'Cause I'm all locked up in this 
Dark place - and I do not know 
I'm good as dead 
My head aches - warped and tied up 
I need to kill this pain 

My head won't leave my head alone 
And I don't believe it will 
'Til I'm dead and gone 
My head won't leave my head alone 
And I don't believe it will 
'Til I'm six feet under ground 

How long I'm tied up 
My mind in knots - my stomach reels 
In concern for what I might do or 
What I've done 
It's got me living in fear 
Well I know these voices must 
Be my soul 
I've had enough 
I've had enough 
Of being alone 
I've got no place to go 

In my grave 
Lying wired shut and quiet in my grave 
Leave me here 
Leave it to me to waste here 

So young here I am again 
Talking to myself 
A TV blares 
Oh man oh how I wish I didn't smoke 
Or drink to reason with my head 
But sometimes this thick confusion 
Grows until I cannot bare it all 
Needle to the vein 
Needle to the vein 
Take this needle from my vein my friend 

In my grave 
Lying lying cold in my grave 
Reason - my reason 
Take my head off this terror 
I'm fearing I'll come back 
I'll see 
My mind's all wiped clean 
The needle 
Make my great escape 
I'll see the cold in time 
My head leaves me behind 
Let me fade away 

I seem caught in time 
My head leaves me behind 
Body falls cold 
And I see heaven
