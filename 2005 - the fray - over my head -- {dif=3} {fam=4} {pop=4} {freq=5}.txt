Original in Ab = G + capo

C,Em,D
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run
Am,G,D
When all I needed was the truth

But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still 
Standing when it clears

C,G,Em,
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit 
Until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above 
As the canyon comes between

(Chorus)
She's on you..

And suddenly I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's 
Am
[d e  c
Effortless
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we 
Am
[d    e  f  e-f-e
Torch it ourselves

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Everyone knows
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm over my...

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
