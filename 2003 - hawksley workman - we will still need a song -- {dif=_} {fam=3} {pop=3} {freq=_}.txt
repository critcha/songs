baby you're
You're drunk and acting tough
I know you're sad
You're not the only one who feels like that now.

And maybe anger is your only choice
But maybe heart and fist and human voice
Might be the better way
Be the way.

Cause we, we will still need a song
To carry our love away.
To carry it away.
We will still need a song
To carry our hearts away.
To carry them away.

Don't let another tear be in your eyes
We can die in peace knowing we tried
To change our own ways.

The poets let a generation down
And modern music could be the healing sound
		 F
It's the only way.
	 Am   G
Only way.

Cause we, we will still need a song
To carry our love away.
To carry it away.
We will still need a song
To dance on our wedding day
To carry it away.

G,D,Dm,Am,G

And we will still need a song(we will still need)
To carry ourselves(to carry ourselves)
To carry ourselves

And we, we will still need a song
To carry our hearts away.
To carry them away.
We will still need a song
To dance on our wedding day
To carry it away.

C+DE,G+D,Dm,F+G

Last chance for being sad
I'm tired of feeling bad

Cause we, we will still need a song
To carry our love away.
We will still need a song
To dance on our wedding day
To carry it away.
